This week we decided to look at a small family-run restaurant in the village of Wardleton. The Old Mill is newly opened and overlooks the River Wardle,and we had heard several favourable comments about it. Because we had been advised to book early, we managed to get a nice table with a view of the quay. We were made very welcome and service was excellent because it is a small family business. The proprietor, Jeff Dean, runs the kitchen himself and his wife, Nelly, showed us to our table. Although the choice of items on the menu was very extensive, it was rather traditional. A long menu always worries me, because a large menu often means a large freezer! We started with Wardle Trout and although it was fresh, it was spoilt by a number of herbs. For my main course I chose the pepper steak,which was the speciality of the day. I thought it was almost perfect because the chef had chosen excellent meat and it was cooked just long enough.My wife ordered the roast lamb, and although the quality of the meat was good, she thought it was a little underdone. Though the vegetables were fresh,they came in very small portions and were rather over-cooked for our taste.However, the bread was fresh because it had been baked on the premises. I have often complained in this column about the difficulty of finding any restaurant which serves a fresh fruit salad. Luckily, this one did. Even though it must have been very time-consuming to prepare, it was a delight to see,and I had a second helping. As usual, I chose house wine, as this is often the best way to judge a restaurant's wine list. It was a French-bottled table wine which was quite satisfactory and reasonably priced. The bill, including coffee and brandy, came to 38 pounds, which was acceptable for the class of restaurant, although that did not include service.
