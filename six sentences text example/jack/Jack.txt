This is my friend, Jack. He is a great friend to me. Jack is tall, with short brown hair and big brown eyes. He has a small nose. Jack is my classmate in school. He is very clever. He works very hard in school. He likes to read books in the library and he also likes to help the teachers in class. He always does his homework! The teachers think Jack is a wonderful student. All my classmates really like Jack. He is a kind boy. If he sees somebody on their own in the playground, Jack will always invite them to play in our game.
