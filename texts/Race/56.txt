If you are in a crowd, a first and most important thing is to make yourself familiar with your surroundings  and mentally notice alternate exits. No matter where you are, make sure you always know how to get out.
Make sure you know the type of ground you are standing on. For example, in a crowd of moving people wet ground can be dangerous, causing you to fall. You should know the general atmosphere of the event, as panic situations can often be predicted. When in danger, a few seconds can make all the difference, giving you the possibility of taking advantage of your escape route. Always stay closer to the escape route
If you find yourself in the middle of a moving crowd, do not fight against the pressure, do not stand still or sit down, because you could easily get injured or even be killed by being stepped on by other people. Instead, move in the same direction of the crowd; take advantage of any space that may open up to move sideways to the crowd movement where the flow is weaker. Keep  your hands up by your chest, which will protect your chest during the movement.
If you fall, get up quickly. If you can't get up because you are injured, get someone to pull you back up. If you fall and can not get up, keep moving by crawling in the same direction of the crowd. Do not lie on your stomach or back, as this is dangerous for your body.
The worst situation is to be pushed by the crowd against an immovable object. Try to shun
High walls, as the crowd pressure can build up rapidly. After you're pushed forward, the way you move is on a diagonal . There's always space between people. You work your way out that way till you get out of the crowd.
