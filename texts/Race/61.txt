Christmas has never looked as beautiful as it is now, when this one-foot-tall mini tree grew from a pothole in the streets of London.
London pothole gardener Steve Wheen , 34 , has created over 150 little gardens so far the smallest one of which is just one-inch-square.
"I really enjoy the reactions of people who come across my work and love them ."said  Steve.  "London can be so grey, especially at this time of year. When l was thinking about  how to brighten it up, gardening came to my mind."
Steve has been pothole gardening for four years, mainly around the streets of London  His  pothole gardens are made with some plants he chooses from his local garden centre.  Each of them  usually costs between five and ten pounds. Although they are often temporary to the streets, Steve is sure that they can be in people's mind for a long time, if they are lucky enough to come  across these small gardens while they go about their daily lives.
"I'm always surprised when I ask people what they think the message is behind my Work ."he said.  "Often they think I'm against or in honor of something.  One person even  considered that l was marking the places where people had died in car accidents."
"I think in a city like London, where it's easy to feel short of green space, my message can be seen as a green one and that's fine with me. "he said.  "The environment is something we all need to be thinking about more and more.  But most importantly, it's all about making people smile and giving them an unexpected moment of happiness."
