When newspapers and radio describe the damage caused by a hurricane  named Hazel, girls named Hazel are probably teased  by their friends. To keep out of trouble, the Weather Bureau says,"Any _ between hurricane names and the names of particular girls is purely accidental."
Some women became angry because hurricanes are given their names, but many other women are proud to see their names make headlines. They don't even care that they are the names of destructive storms. Because more women seem to like it than dislike it, the Weather Bureau has decided to continue using girl's names for hurricanes.
In some ways a hurricane is like a person. After it is born, it grows and develops, then becomes old and dies. Each hurricane has a character of its own. Each follows its own path through the world, and people remember it long after it gone. So it is natural to give hurricanes' names, and to talk about them almost if they were alive.
