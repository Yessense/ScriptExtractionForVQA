Keen to share your views and have your articles published in the Campus Link? We are calling for contributions to the following sections:
Lifestyle:
Do you travel widely, keep a journal of your adventures and have nice photographs that you might want to share? Or have you simply been somewhere that caught your imagination? Tell us all about your travels!
Are you an eager movie-goer? Be Leonard Maltin for the day and share your views of the latest blockbuster   with our readers!
If food is your preferred choice of relaxation, try your hand at being food critic and send us your views on food/restaurants worth trying.
Research:
If this noble line of work is your bread and butter or passion, we want to hear from you! Share with Campus Link your research developments and breakthroughs. If you know of someone (your schoolmate or teacher) whose research work is a source of inspiration for our community, do not hesitate to send in your suggestions!
If you are interested in sharing any of the above, or if you know of someone worthy of feature, please get in touch with the Editor-in-Chief, at karinyeo@campuslink.sg.
